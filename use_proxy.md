# How to use a Proxy
This guide will detail how to use one of the proxies. (for n00bs :P)

## 1. Choose Your Proxy
*The Tools* offers many proxies, and you are free to choose whichever one you want!
When choosing your proxy, consider a few things:
* How fast the proxy is
* How easy is it to remember the URL
* How well it loads the content (Some proxies are better at this than others)

## 2. Use The Proxy
Generally, you will want to find a search bar on the website.
Just paste the link that you want to unblock into the search bar, and press enter!
