# Bypass GoGuardian
There are a few ways to bypass GoGuardian on chromebooks.
The easiest way is to **sign into two or more chromebooks**.
This works because GoGuardian only accepts one license at a time for its respective instances, and attempting to load more than one will result in the license malfunctioning.
This may not work as well or with increased probability of failure since GoGuardian has gone through several internal changes.
